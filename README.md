# Project Group 17: Decision Tree Visualization

There is a strong need for researchers to visualize a decision tree in an effective way and for doctors to see the hierarchy and track the flow of diabetes patients from the decision tree. To solve this problem, we identify our usersâ€™ need and build a visualization tool by d3 and python allowing users to view and explore a decision tree built by a diabetes dataset. We present a new way for users to use the binary results and visualize the decision tree by a vertical node-link way for better representing the structure of the tree. Domain experts are also supported in growing, pruning and analysing decision tree by a statistics panel. 

To run this application locally, simply pull the entire directory and run index.html.

Our final proposal will be posted here when complete.

Our final video presentation will be posted here when complete.

# Project Group 17: Decision Tree Visualization

Researchers from the 'patientviz' [Github respository](https://github.com/nyuvis/patient-viz) project need information visualization method to find the interesting patterns that hide in the data. Decision trees, as a popular and commonly used model of data mining, can efficiently classify the data with good accuracy. Our goal of the visualization tool is to provide users the hierachy of the decision tree, detailed view of the tree, pruning functions for the tree and track every patient inside the tree.

The data in this interactive decision tree application is from the CMS Linkable 2008–2010 Medicare Data Entrepreneurs’ Synthetic Public Use File (DE­SynPUF). The data contain synthesized data taken from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 2008 and their claims from 2008 to 2010. The training dataset is obtained from the ‘patient­viz’ by runing the code provided. We take the 31829 records from the updating dataset. 

To run this application locally, simply pull the entire directory and run index.html.

Our final proposal will be posted here when complete.

Our final video presentation will be posted here when complete.
